# QantumRandomNumer
Qantum random number generator 

This code creates a quantum random number generator using the following steps:

Sets up a quantum circuit with a specified number of qubits
Applies Hadamard gates to put each qubit in superposition (50/50 chance of 0 or 1)
Measures the qubits to collapse the superposition into classical bits
Converts the binary measurements into decimal numbers
